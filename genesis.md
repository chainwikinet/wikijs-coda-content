## Genesis Token Program

Become one of 1000 community members to receive a token grant.

You'll complete challenges on testnet, learn how to operate the protocol, receive public recognition on our leaderboard, and help to strengthen the Coda network and community.

### Details

Up to 1000 members will be selected from our testnet community to receive a distribution of 66,000 tokens as founding members of Genesis.

* At mainnet launch, 6.6% of the protocol will be distributed in this manner.<br>
* Distributions will be locked up for up to four years after mainnet launch.<br>
* Starting on mainnet launch, Genesis founding members will have to participate as block producers and continuously stake all tokens received from the Genesis Program.<br>
* New Genesis founding members will be announced on a rolling basis.<br>
* To learn more about the selection criteria and requirements, see the Terms and Conditions. https://codaprotocol.com/tcgenesis
